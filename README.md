# Lab 1: Introduction to Julia and GitHub

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is the repository for Lab 1 for [BEE 4750](https://viveks.me/environmental-systems-analysis), taught at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu) in Fall 2025 by [Vivek Srikrishnan](https://viveks.me).

If enrolled in the class, a PDF of the completed notebook, **with all cells evaluated**, should be submitted to Gradescope *no later* than Friday, September 1, 2023, at 9:00pm. 10% will be deducted for each day that the notebook is late.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, students will be able to:

- work with Julia and Jupyter notebooks;
- write basic Julia functions;
- make a basic plot using `Plots.jl`.
- commit `git` repositories and push updates to GitHub.


## Repository Overview

The repository consists of the following files:

- `lab01.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the homework assignment. Students should create code or Markdown blocks as necessary to answer questions. **This is the only file you should need to edit.**
- `Project.toml`, `Manifest.toml`: Julia environment files. These should just work, but feel free to add other packages as needed using the `Pkg` package manager. **This is the only other file that you might end up making changes to, though you should do this using `Pkg`, not directly.**
- `lab01.qmd`: Source file for Jupyter notebook generation. You shouldn't need to or want to touch this; everything is in the `.ipynb` file.
- `LICENSE`: This material is licensed using the MIT license. You can ignore this for working on the problem set.
- `README.md`: This file. You shouldn't need to touch this.
- `.gitignore`: This tells `git` what files to ignore. You shouldn't need to touch this.
- `.github/`: This folder contains workflow files which generate a PDF from a notebook. Again, you shouldn't need to touch this.

## Dependencies

This lab uses on the following packages:

- `Plots.jl` (basic plotting library)
- `LaTeXStrings.jl` (use LaTeX for mathematical markdown in Plots)

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) before beginning this lab. This notebook was developed with version 1.11.5, but any 1.11.x should work (there could be some issues with other versions, depending on what's changed).
2. If necessary, [install git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) and [create a GitHub account](https://github.com).
